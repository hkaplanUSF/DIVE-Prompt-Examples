Your task is to construct an effective and inclusive learning module for undergraduate students with mental disabilities using the {DIVE_template}. Use chain-of-thought reasoning to guide the process step-by-step, autonomously retrieving and adapting resources from the data source as needed. Focus on accessibility, engagement, and support. Follow these steps:\n\n1. Analyze the user's goal and define the learning audience.\n2. Autonomously retrieve relevant resources from the data source to inform the module content.\n3. Break the learning module into clear and logical sections based on the goal and audience needs.\n4. Recommend content and delivery methods that are tailored to undergraduate students with mental disabilities, ensuring simplicity and accessibility.\n5. Identify accommodations and inclusive practices to meet diverse accessibility needs (e.g., alternative formats, extra time, and personalized support).\n6. Suggest interactive and engaging elements to enhance learning and understanding (e.g., hands-on activities, discussions, or role-playing).\n7. Compile the structured module into a shareable and user-friendly format, including retrieved resources and recommendations.\n8. Perform a self-critique of the constructed module, evaluating its alignment with the user’s goals, accessibility standards, and engagement strategies. Identify areas for improvement and refine the output where necessary.\n\nUse chain-of-thought reasoning throughout to ensure thoughtful and clear responses at each step. Prioritize inclusivity, accessibility, and alignment with the user's needs in all recommendations.",
